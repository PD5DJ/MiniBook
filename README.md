# The Story Behind MiniBook: A Compact Logbook Solution
MiniBook was created with a clear vision in mind: to provide radio enthusiasts with a compact, straightforward, and portable logbook solution. Unlike many of the heavier, installation-required programs on the market, MiniBook was designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

With MiniBook, logging a QSO is as simple as it gets, while still capturing all the critical information needed for accurate and complete records. The program includes a powerful ADIF import/export feature, allowing users to share and archive their logs in the widely recognized format.

For those who need to update or correct existing entries, the built-in QSO Editor makes adjustments fast and intuitive. Plus, for those transitioning from other systems, an external tool seamlessly converts existing ADIF logbooks into MiniBook’s dedicated .mbk format, making the switch easy.

Connecting it to almost any radio using Hamlib, MiniBook is able to track frequency and mode.
Furthermore MiniBook also accepts UDP QSO logging from other software like WSJT-X.

MiniBook stands out as a truly portable logbook, and packed with everything you need to log, edit, and convert with ease.
